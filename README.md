# Starry Night Interactive Painting
We propose making an interactive version of Van Gogh's Starry Night, which invites the user to blow on the painting, triggering LEDs behind the painting to blink in different patterns, resembling the movement of stars and wind. The bottom right of the painting includes a town with houses that will also have LEDs that turn on and off to mimic people moving about the town.

## Summary

Here, write a paragraph or two describing what you built for your final project and what was challenging. 

Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

## Component Parts

An artistic representation of Starry Night was painted on a large sheet of paper that allowed the light of the LEDs to diffuse through.

Components:
Cardboard frame with wooden supports and a large sheet of semi-transparent paper to display painting
Microphone to detect userâ€™s breath (INPUT)
Individual neopixels soldered together and a neopixel strip, to resemble stars and wind (OUTPUT)

## Challenges

A brief discussion of what was hard, challenging, or unexpected about your project.

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal 
- Week 2: Purchase microphone and neopixels and create a mockup of where we wanted all of the LEDs to be 
- Week 3: Programmed sensors and finalized layout of LEDs
- Week 4: Finished painting Starry Night, created frame
- Week 5: Assembled all components, debugged neopixels, presented
